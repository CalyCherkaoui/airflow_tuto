# In Python, the rshift operator (>>) is used to set dependencies between tasks. 
# In the DAG, the download_launches task is set to run before the get_pictures task,
# which is set to run before the notify task. This means that the download_launches task will run first,
# followed by the get_pictures task, and finally the notify task.
